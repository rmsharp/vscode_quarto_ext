"""Methodology Dashboard -- Portfolio health and methodology compliance scanner.

Scans sibling project directories for git repositories, collects metrics across
7 dimensions (git, files, tests, CI/CD, docs, methodology, dependencies), scores
health and risk, generates a self-contained HTML dashboard, and opens it in the
default browser.

Part of the Iterative Session Methodology.
https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology

MODES
-----
The dashboard auto-detects its context based on where it's placed:

  Portfolio mode (parent directory is NOT a git repo):
    Scans all sibling git repositories as separate projects.

       ~/projects/                       <-- put methodology_dashboard.py here
       ~/projects/project-a/             <-- scanned as project
       ~/projects/project-b/             <-- scanned as project

  Single-project mode (placed inside a git repo):
    Scans the project itself, plus any git submodules as separate entries.

       ~/projects/my-app/                <-- put methodology_dashboard.py here
       ~/projects/my-app/lib/submodule/  <-- scanned as separate entry

SETUP
-----
1. Copy this file to your desired location (see Modes above).

2. Run:

       python3 methodology_dashboard.py

   This generates dashboard.html, opens it in your browser, and prints a
   terminal summary. The HTML auto-refreshes every 60 seconds — leave it
   open and re-run the script whenever you want updated data.

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
- EXCLUDE_DIRS: Add directory names to skip during project discovery.
  By default, common non-project directories are excluded. The methodology
  repo itself is deliberately NOT excluded — it is scored like any other
  project, and --sync skips it as a target on its own (it authors this file
  rather than receiving it).

- WALK_SKIP: Directories skipped during file traversal (build artifacts,
  vendor dependencies, etc.).

- METHODOLOGY_ITEMS: The weighted checklist used for compliance scoring.
  Adjust weights to match what matters most for your team. This is the
  checklist for a repo that ADOPTS the methodology.

- FRAMEWORK_ITEMS: The separate checklist scored instead of METHODOLOGY_ITEMS
  when a repo is detected as PUBLISHING the methodology rather than consuming
  it — a framework publisher owes different artifacts than an adopter, so
  scoring it against adopter-root files reports a false "partial adoption".

- .methodology-profile: A repo-root marker that overrules either structural
  detection when the heuristic is wrong about your repo. Only its first line
  that is neither blank nor a comment is read. It carries whitespace-separated
  tokens from two independent axes: repo CLASS (doc-only | code) and repo ROLE
  (framework | adopter). Naming one token of a pair forces that classification;
  naming both abstains on that axis alone and falls back to detection. Declaring
  is exact where detection is a guess.

# The compliance DENOMINATOR — derived from the checklist itself, never written as a literal.
# History is the argument for deriving it: the original six items summed to exactly 100, so the
# "%" label and a bare `* 0.2` health dimension were correct *by construction*; two 5-point items
# were later appended without re-cutting the scale, and from then on a fully-compliant project
# rendered "110%" over a 22-of-20 sub-score. A hardcoded denominator is what drifted, so a
# hardcoded 100 would drift again the next time this list grows.
#
# Adopter-root files that the methodology distributes are expected to appear on this checklist or
# to be recorded as deliberately unscored — an invariant the canonical test suite enforces against
# the distribution manifest (tools/test_methodology_dashboard.py, CHECKLIST_EXEMPT), since the
# manifest is canonical-only and an adopter's copy has nothing to check itself against.
METHODOLOGY_MAX = sum(weight for _, weight, _ in METHODOLOGY_ITEMS)

# The FRAMEWORK checklist — scored instead of METHODOLOGY_ITEMS when detect_repo_role says this
# repo PUBLISHES the methodology rather than consuming it. METHODOLOGY_ITEMS lists adopter-root
# DESTINATIONS; a distributor does not install a second copy of its own corpus into its own root,
# so grading it against that list asks a question it was never going to answer yes to.
#
# Two halves, both checkable by existence:
#   - does it publish a complete corpus (the artifacts an adopter receives, plus the machinery
#     that delivers them)?
#   - does it OPERATE the methodology it publishes (the root action ledger and close-out
#     receipts it asks every adopter to keep)?
# The second half is why the role swap is not a hiding place: without it, becoming a "framework"
# repo would stop the scanner asking whether the publisher runs its own rules.
#
# NOT SCORED, deliberately: the two paths detect_repo_role uses to prove the role
# (bin/_manifest.py, starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md). If the evidence for the role also earned
# points, the raw sum would have a nonzero floor on the structural path and the "no corpus at
# all" branch would become an assertion over an input that can never occur — the same
# unreachable-signal defect this campaign exists to close, re-created inside its own fix. Their
# provenance is DISPLAYED on the card instead.
#
# NOT SCORED for a different reason: any distribution SEED source. Those are placeholders here
# (starter-kit/SESSION_NOTES.md is a 27-line stub, starter-kit/ROADMAP.md an 18-line skeleton),
# and crediting a placeholder is precisely the harm the prohibition in the campaign plan's
# §"Layer 4 — Repo role" names. (Cited by section, not by line: that plan says outright it is the
# second time its line citations went stale, and this one had already drifted 255 -> 275.)

# --- D4(b): the agent Read cap ----------------------------------------------------------------
# A SECOND large-file question, deliberately NOT a widening of the BL-5 code-smell check in
# assess_risks(). BL-5 asks "is this MODULE unwieldy?" — a judgment about structure, false for a
# 2,500-line chapter, which is why .md is excluded there and `vendor` after it: two consecutive
# narrowings, both earned by measured false positives. This asks "does a file a session must read
# IN FULL still fit in one read?" — a fact about the harness, true or false whatever the file is
# for. Separating them is ADDED POLICY: the ratified design says only that a 2,090-line .md must
# be able to trip *a* large-file risk, and taking that literally would regress BL-5's test.
#
# UNIT: LINES, because the cap is in lines. Bytes are not a proxy — measured in this repo,
# HANDOFFS.md runs ~265 B/line and CHANGELOG.md ~83 B/line, so any single byte threshold is wrong
# for one of them by ~3x, and would flag the file that is NOT truncating while missing the one
# that did.
# VALUE: harness behaviour, not a repo property and not taste — a Read past it returns the first
# 2,000 lines with no error and no missing-data marker. Same name, same value and same stated
# reason as starter-kit/methodology_trim.py's READ_CAP_LINES, so the reporter and the remedy
# cannot disagree about where the cliff is; a canonical test pins the two literals together.
# BASIS — the failure already happened here, and was found by accident rather than by any check:
#   git show 3aee4e3^:CHANGELOG.md | wc -l    -> 2,090
# Phase 0's reconcile then computed a frontier against a record it could not fully see.
READ_CAP_LINES = 2000

# The files a session is instructed to read IN FULL to establish state — SESSION_RUNNER.md
# Phase 0 step 2 (SESSION_NOTES.md), step 3 (BACKLOG.md), step 6 (reconcile CHANGELOG.md and
# HANDOFFS.md against git log) — restricted to the ones the ADOPTER owns.
#
# Written as a literal, NOT derived from METHODOLOGY_ITEMS, because two of that checklist's file
# entries — SESSION_RUNNER.md and SAFEGUARDS.md — are TRACKED dests in bin/_manifest.py: files we
# install and keep current. Flagging those would re-earn Layer 7's narrowing at fleet scale, since
# one canonical breach would light up every adopter at once over a file they cannot edit. Every
# name below is a SEED dest (bin/sync writes a short stub once; adopter-owned forever after) or
# never a dest at all, so every line past the cap is the adopter's own record. A canonical test
# asserts that against bin/_manifest.py rather than restating it in a comment here.
#
# ROADMAP.md is a SEED too and is deliberately absent: the runner cites it as a pointer, never as
# a file read whole to compute anything. Absent above all: a book chapter. Nobody is instructed to
# read chap07.md in full, so truncating it produces no wrong answer — flagging it would re-create
# the very false positive BL-5's ext filter, one signal over, exists to kill.

# --- S38: the trim-trigger row ------------------------------------------------------------------
# D4(b) above reports a file that is ALREADY truncating. This reports the file that is heading
# there, and names what to do about it. The two are separate risks on purpose and neither
# subsumes the other: the ledgers in this repo are both well under the line cap today and both
# already over the byte budget, so a cap-only reporter is silent about the live problem.
#
# THE ARCHITECTURE, AND WHY THE DASHBOARD COMPUTES RATHER THAN ASKS. The design (§1.3) says the
# dashboard "reads the number rather than re-deriving it" AND that S38 owes an agreement test --
# "with the trimmer present, the dashboard's displayed headroom equals --check's". Those cannot
# both hold. A number OBTAINED by parsing `--check` makes that test an identity, which cannot
# fail; the repo has already paid for that mistake once (Learning #16 -- three losslessness
# guards inert at their call site behind a 13/13 mutation score). The owed test is only
# meaningful if the two sides are computed independently, so this module computes the line
# metric itself and the test compares it against a real `--check` run.
#
# That also keeps the rows READ-ONLY, which the ratified architecture requires, and matches
# §7.1's stated precedent: check_stale_version()/parse_version() interrogate another executable
# BY REGEX, without importing or running it. Nothing here executes a file it discovered.
#
# What is genuinely the trimmer's and cannot be re-derived is the BYTE BUDGET -- a judgment
# calibrated in design §5.4, not a formula. It is read out of the tool's source by regex, the
# same way parse_version reads DASHBOARD_VERSION. No budget -> the byte half abstains out loud
# (decision D4: a 0 from an unread source must not be reported as a clean state), and the line
# half, whose formula is published in CHANGELOG.md's own front matter, still answers.

#
# ITS ORIGINAL REASON EXPIRED AT S39' AND THE SURVIVING ONE IS NARROWER. When this was written the
# tool was canonical-only, so the root probe missed on EVERY repo in existence and the present
# branch would have shipped never having run anywhere. `bin/sync` now installs the trimmer at
# adopter roots, so the root probe is the live path for every adopter and this fallback covers
# exactly one case: the framework repo scanning itself. Measured on a real sync rather than
# reasoned about -- find_trim_tool() on a freshly synced throwaway repo returns
# `methodology_trim.py` (the ROOT candidate), v1.0.0, budget 65536, and the fleet-wide `low`

# Doc-only / research-repo scoring reshape (BL-5). A document-only repo (papers, dissertations,
# technical reports, regulatory analyses — the Research-Documentation workstream population, and
# partly this framework's own doc corpus) has nothing to unit-test, so the code-centric Testing
# dimension and its risks are a false penalty. When a repo is detected as doc-only, the second
# 0-20 score slot (dict key "testing", kept stable for JSON/portfolio/radar) is filled by a
# Render/Verification score instead, and the no-test-infra / thin-coverage risks are suppressed.
#
# The Render/Verification score is an HONEST PROXY: a static git+file scan cannot execute a
# render, so it measures render/verification *configuration and wiring* (toolchain configs, the
# v2.5 render-dependency checks like pdffonts/fc-list/kpsewhich, a docs-render / link-check CI
# pipeline, Research-Documentation verification artifacts) — never render *success*. It is
# labeled a proxy in the HTML card. Like every dimension here it is advisory; nothing hard-fails.
#
# Detection is marker-override -> source-cap -> corpus-disjunction (see detect_doc_only). The
# source cap keeps a mixed tooling repo (real code that should be tested) from being silently
# exempted; the bidirectional .methodology-profile marker lets an owner force either classification.
# These three thresholds are deliberate, stated round-number heuristics, not derived from a
# measured corpus of adopter repos — record that plainly rather than let the round numbers read
# as calibrated. DOC_ONLY_SOURCE_LOC_MAX in particular decides which of two scoring regimes a
# repo gets (see the 148-LOC misclassification documented near FRAMEWORK_INSTALLED_DOCS below), so a

DOC_ONLY_DOC_FILES_MIN  = 3              # this many doc files also signals a real doc corpus

# The .methodology-profile marker answers TWO independent questions as of 2.10.0, so it is named
# for the file rather than for either axis. Each axis is a bidirectional pair: naming one token
# forces that classification, naming both abstains on THAT AXIS ONLY (decision D4 — a
# declaration this scanner cannot read is disclosed, never resolved by guessing), and tokens
# belonging to neither pair are ignored so an older synced twin cannot crash or flip on a marker
# naming an axis it has never heard of.
#
# The two pairs must stay DISJOINT: one file is one token bag, so a token serving both axes would
# let a single word silently answer two questions. A canonical test asserts it.

# Non-markdown files `bin/sync` installs into an ADOPTER project root, as adopter-relative dest
# paths, each paired with HOW THAT FILE PROVES IT IS OURS. Installing the methodology must not
# change how the adopter's OWN code is measured: these executables are thousands of lines against a
# 200-LOC doc-only cap, so counting them as adopter source made `bin/sync` destroy the very
# fair-scoring v3.2 shipped (a synced Quarto book flipped doc_only True -> False and got its "No
# test infrastructure" penalty back). The signal did not mean what it appeared to mean: it meant
# *we put our own tools in your repo and then counted them against you*. See §"Layer 7" of the
# campaign plan, which lives on the fork's `main` only:
# https://github.com/rmsharp/methodology/blob/main/docs/planning/dashboard-signal-integrity-plan.md
#
# Mirrors the non-markdown dests in bin/_manifest.py; a canonical test asserts the two agree, so
# the pair cannot drift silently (that plan's §8 learning 1 — make the cross-reference
# machine-checkable, not re-greppable). Markdown dests are deliberately NOT listed: this table
# exists to correct the source-LOC read, and a general "skip framework files" rule is exactly the
# laundering hole the exclusion must not become.
#
# WHY A TABLE AND NOT A TUPLE (S39', when the trimmer became the second installed executable).
# The membership list and the content gate were separate before, and that made one specific wrong
# edit both easy and green: `test_exclusion_list_matches_the_manifest` goes red the moment the
# manifest grows a non-markdown dest, and the cheapest way to green it is to append the name here.
# Measured, that edit accomplishes NOTHING — with `methodology_trim.py` on the old tuple and no
# content branch for it, the adopter fixture still read doc_only False, source_loc 1,632 and a HIGH
# "No test infrastructure". A green 323-test suite over a live fleet-wide regression. Deriving
# FRAMEWORK_INSTALLED_SOURCE from these keys makes that edit unwritable: a name reaches the
# exclusion only by declaring how it identifies itself.
#
# Each value is (version_pattern, structural_signatures). A file passes if the version pattern
# matches, or if it carries >= _FRAMEWORK_SIGNATURE_MIN of the signatures. An EMPTY signature tuple
# means "no structural fallback": sum(...) over it is 0, which cannot reach the minimum of 2, so the
# version constant is then the only way in. That is correct for a tool with no pre-constant releases
# in the wild, and it is pinned by a test rather than left to arithmetic a reader has to redo.
#
# The two patterns are deliberately DISTINCT rather than one generic version matcher. Widening
# _VERSION_RE would have been the smaller diff and it has two other consumers — parse_version() and
# check_stale_version(), which drives the "methodology_dashboard.py is stale" warning — so it would
# have changed staleness reporting as a side effect. Distinct patterns also mean neither tool's
# constant can launder the other's file, which a shared any-marker rule would have allowed.
# Structural signatures of the SCANNER, for copies too old to carry DASHBOARD_VERSION. Two must
# match. Three are ordinary function names, so two hits are suggestive rather than proof — this is
# a heuristic, and the .methodology-profile marker is the documented override. Measured need: a
# live adopter (feedback-loop-comparison) still runs a 1,614-line pre-version copy, and a
# DASHBOARD_VERSION-only gate silently skipped it — the fix quietly not applying is the same class
# of defect as the fix being wrong. (Moved up from below `is_framework_installed` at S39' so it is

# The markdown half of the same problem, and the mirror of the defect above. `bin/sync` also

# than fixing it: a 148-LOC utility repo that correctly read `code` before sync read `doc-only`
# after it, and lost a TRUE "No test infrastructure" risk. The old source cap had been masking
# that; removing the cap's grip on synced repos exposes it.
#
# ALL 22 markdown dests are listed, TRACKED *and* SEED. Listing only the 18 TRACKED ones was
# tried first, on the reasoning that a SEED is adopter-owned from creation (bin/_manifest.py) —
# and MEASURED AGAINST A REAL `bin/sync` RUN it does not close the hole: the four seeds
# (SESSION_NOTES/CHANGELOG/HANDOFFS/ROADMAP) plus the adopter's own README are 5 doc files, which
# clears DOC_ONLY_DOC_FILES_MIN (3) by themselves, so the 148-LOC fixture still flipped to
# doc-only. At sync time a seed is OUR template, not the adopter's writing; it only becomes their
# content later. The corpus question is "does this repo hold a real document corpus?", and a set
# of methodology bookkeeping files is not one no matter who later edits it.
#
# Used ONLY by detect_doc_only's corpus check, by operator decision: the question "is this a
# DOCUMENT project?" must not be answered with documents we installed. No content check is needed
# here (unlike the source list): excluding docs can only make doc-only classification HARDER, so
# a repo cannot use this list to launder anything — it would only penalize itself.
#
# SPLIT INTO THREE TIERS by how much a name's mere presence PROVES. Layer 7 split "distinctive"
# from "seed" and gated only the seeds; Layer 8 corrected where that line falls, because six of
# the names it called distinctive are nothing of the kind.
#
# Only a path UNDER docs/methodology/ is self-evidencing. That directory is this framework's own
# install location, so nothing lands there by coincidence.
#
# A bare ROOT filename proves nothing on its own, and calling it distinctive was a MEASURED
# REGRESSION against the pre-Layer-7 scanner: a documentation project that never heard of this
# framework, whose corpus was its own 302-line root `BOOTSTRAP.md`, had that file discounted, fell
# under DOC_ONLY_DOC_LOC_MIN, flipped `doc-only -> code`, and gained a false HIGH "No test
# infrastructure" — v3.2's exact false penalty, re-created a second time by the fix for its mirror.
# `BOOTSTRAP.md` and `SAFEGUARDS.md` are ordinary names for any onboarding or policy repo.
# Worse, ONE coincidental root name also unlocked the seed fold-in below, so the same repo's own
# CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md were discounted too — one accident defeating the very gate Layer 7
# added to protect those four. Found by the pre-PR review; reproduced under both scanners.

    authors those files, so its own health score must keep paying for them.

    Content-verified, PER NAME: each installed executable proves itself with its own constant —
    the scanner with `DASHBOARD_VERSION` (or, for copies predating it, at least two structural
    signatures of the scanner), the trimmer with `TRIM_VERSION`, the context-budget gate with its
    own `VERSION`. The pairing lives in `_FRAMEWORK_INSTALLED_CONTENT`, which this reads rather
    than re-stating, and which FRAMEWORK_INSTALLED_SOURCE is derived from — so no name can be
    excluded without declaring how it identifies itself. No tool's constant satisfies another
    entry's check. The **whole file** is
    read,
    not a fixed prefix — an earlier version searched only the first 4096 bytes, and the real
    constant sits close enough to that boundary that ordinary growth of this module header would
    have crossed it, silently switching the exclusion off and regressing every doc-only adopter
    to the defect this exists to fix. (Measured at 2.10.1: byte 3,409, only 687 bytes clear of
    the old window. That margin is a snapshot, not an invariant — it was 1,572 bytes one commit
    earlier, and a single docstring addition consumed 56% of it, which is exactly the hazard.
    test_predicate_reads_the_whole_file_not_a_prefix is what actually holds the line.)
    A silent cliff inside the fix for a silent-signal bug is
    not a tradeoff worth keeping; the read costs nothing, since the file is read for line-counting
    anyway.

    **The threat model is accidental miscounting, not an adversarial adopter.** These checks make
    it unlikely that the scanner mistakes an adopter's own work for ours. They do NOT stop someone who

    Within a base, an exact `CHANGELOG.md` (any case) wins over every name-prefix sibling:
    `sorted()` alone returned `CHANGELOG-archive.md` ahead of `CHANGELOG.md` ('-' is 0x2D, '.' is

    reported as lagging behind its own history. The prefix search remains as the fallback, so a
    project whose only changelog is `CHANGELOG.rst` is still measured.

    The preference is scoped WITHIN a base on purpose, so the pre-existing root-over-docs
    precedence is preserved exactly. Hoisting it across bases would additionally fix a root that
    holds only `CHANGELOG-archive.md` while an exact `docs/CHANGELOG.md` exists — but it would also
    silently move which file is measured, and with it the ±1 freshness point, for the repo shape

    where nothing is being shadowed and no defect here asks for a change. D3 is specifically about
    a fix that moves a score it claimed not to touch, so the narrower reading shipped. Both
    arrangements — the one fixed and the one deliberately left alone — are pinned by tests.

    The methodology removes a backlog item from BACKLOG.md in the same commit that logs it to
    CHANGELOG.md, so a surviving done-mark is a proxy for 'completed but never migrated'.

    Returns `{"format", "done", "recognized", "source"}`. ABSTENTION IS A FIRST-CLASS RESULT
    (campaign decision D4): a `done` of 0 from a format this scanner cannot read is
    indistinguishable from a genuinely clean backlog, and that silence IS defect 4 — a real
    643-line table backlog carrying 256 done-marks reported "nothing unmigrated" for as long as
    the predicate was checkbox-only. So the count now travels with the convention it was read
    under, and `recognized` states whether the count can be trusted at all.

    The six formats, in decision order:

    - `unreadable` — the file exists but could not be read. Abstains: an I/O error is the one case
      where a 0 is guaranteed to mean nothing at all.
    - `checkbox`  — `- [x]` / `- [ ]` marks, counted by the unchanged checkbox regex. The count is
      unchanged for every input EXCEPT one this layer deliberately moves: marks inside a closed
      fenced block are no longer counted, because a documented example is not work.
    - `table`     — a table declaring a Status column, counted by the tuned predicate above.
    - `unrecognized` — item-bearing content whose done convention cannot be read: a table with no
      Status column (this repo's own `| Item | Scope | Outcome |` backlog), or plain list items
      with neither checkboxes nor a table. Abstains out loud.
    - `none`      — no checkboxes, no tables, no list items. NOT an abstention: an empty backlog is
      the healthy state and 0 is a correct measurement of it. Keeping this distinct is what stops
      the disclosure from firing on every adopter who is simply up to date.
    - `absent`    — no BACKLOG.md at any known location; nothing to recognize.

    `recognized` is True only for `checkbox` and `table` — the two formats whose count can be
    trusted. It is False for `none` and `absent` too, where the 0 is correct but is not the result
    of reading a convention; those two are distinguished from the abstaining formats by staying

    present names a command the adopter can actually run, built from the located path; absent
    never does. Every advisory names the file it was computed against rather than saying "the
    ledger" -- a generic noun in this position once sent an adopter to update a product
    release-notes file while the real finding stayed suppressed.

    ONE DEPARTURE FROM §7.3, LABELLED AS SUCH RATHER THAN DRESSED AS A READING. The design says
    the absent branch "names the documented manual procedure". There is no such procedure to
    name: no distributed file documents ledger archiving, which is precisely what queue item S40
    is for (design §11 Phase 5 says so itself -- "Today zero distributed files say anything on
    the subject"). Verified over the WHOLE distributed set, not a convenient corner of it -- the
    design's own check greps `starter-kit/*.md`, which matches 11 of the 24 manifest entries, and
    a claim about "no distributed file" cannot be settled by a net that misses 11 of them
    (`HOW_TO_USE.md`, `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`, and nine `workstreams/*.md`):
      python3 -c "import sys;sys.path.insert(0,'bin');import _manifest as m;\
        print('\n'.join(sorted(e[0] for e in m.DISTRIBUTION if e[0].endswith('.md'))))" \
        | xargs grep -l -i archiv
    -> `starter-kit/FRAMEWORK_LEARNINGS.md` (Learning #15's prose about PROVING a split lossless,
       not a procedure for performing one), `HOW_TO_USE.md` (a worked example project's
       `POST /projects/:id/archive` endpoint), and, since S39', `starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` (the
       one-line inventory entry describing what the newly distributed tool DOES -- a tool
       description, not a policy: it states no size norm, no trigger, and no procedure). None of
       the three documents ledger archiving, so the verdict is unchanged and the departure below
       still stands. The narrower `starter-kit/*.md` grep reached the same verdict, which is luck,
       not method -- and this result line is itself the demonstration, having gone from two files
       to three inside the very session that shipped the tool. Re-run it; do not read it.
    The `.md` filter is not cosmetic either: run unfiltered and the distributed set also returns
    THIS FILE, because the paragraph you are reading contains the word. A measurement that
    includes the measurer is the trap one over from the narrow-population one, and the fix for
    both is to state the population beside the number.
    So the absent branch states the measurement and says plainly that the byte half did not run.
    Inventing a destination would be the exact misdirection §7.3 exists to prevent. WHEN S40
    LANDS, this branch should point at the seed ledger's own archiving section.

    # remedy, and BOTH halves of the reason it used to give have since expired: the conditional
    # naming it deferred to queue item S38 shipped in 2.12.0 (collect_trim_metrics), and the

    # ledger past both thresholds two remedies for one problem. The dedup between the two rows is
