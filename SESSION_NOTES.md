# Session Notes

**Purpose:** Continuity between sessions. Each session reads this first and writes to it before closing out.

---

## ACTIVE TASK
**Task:** Implement **Phase 1** of the architecture plan — the walking skeleton: scaffold (TypeScript + esbuild + `package.json` + MIT `LICENSE`) + `Quarto: Verify Installation` command + `quarto/cli.ts` resolution infra + the `core/`-vs-adapter boundary + the test harness.
**Status:** NOT STARTED. **The plan is COMPLETE** (Session 1) but is a **DRAFT awaiting operator ratification** of the four decisions in plan §12 (v1 scope, Tier B not Tier C, tech stack, base grammar). Confirm those with the operator before writing code.
**Plan:** `docs/planning/2026-06-27-extension-architecture-plan.md` → implement **Phase 1 ONLY**, then close out (FM #18: do not bundle Phase 2).
**Priority:** HIGH

### What You Must Do
This is an **implementation** session (Development workstream). The deliverable is Phase 1's walking skeleton — an installable `.vsix` whose one command verifies the Quarto install.
1. Confirm §12 ratification with the operator first (the plan is a draft until they approve scope + stack).
2. Read `docs/planning/2026-06-27-extension-architecture-plan.md` §3.3 (the `core/`-vs-adapter boundary — load-bearing), §6 Phase 1, §10 (testing), §13 (quick ref).
3. Build exactly Phase 1's scope. Verify with: `npm run compile`, `npm test`, `npx @vscode/vsce package`, manual F5 (`Quarto: Verify Installation` shows `quarto 1.7.33`). Record the F5 result per Phase 3E.
4. **Load-bearing check in Phase 1:** confirm `@vscode/test-electron` can download VS Code in this environment (no `code` CLI on PATH). If it cannot, document the gap — do not pretend integration tests run.
5. Close out after Phase 1. Do NOT start Phase 2 (FM #2 keep-going, FM #18 bleed).

### Useful starting context
- Quarto CLI installed: `quarto 1.7.33`. Node `v22.21.1`, npm `11.10.0`. **No `code` CLI on PATH** → runtime verification is manual F5; pure-core tests run headlessly.
- The load-bearing TextMate-vs-LSP decision is **RESOLVED** in the plan §3: ship Tier A (grammar), build to Tier B (in-process providers), defer Tier C (out-of-process LSP). Guardrail: the intelligence core is `vscode`-free.
- **Licensing (hard):** Posit's official extension/LSP/visual-editor are **AGPL-3.0** — look-but-don't-copy. Build on MIT upstreams (plan §2.4). Quarto CLI is MIT.

### How You Will Be Evaluated
The user rates every session's handoff. Your handoff will be scored on:
1. Was the ACTIVE TASK block sufficient to orient the next session?
2. Were key files listed with line numbers?
3. Were gotchas and traps flagged?
4. Was the "what's next" actionable and specific?

### What Session 1 Did — 2026-06-27
**Deliverable:** Planning session (Architecture workstream) — feature inventory + phased architecture/implementation plan for the Quarto VS Code extension. **COMPLETE.**

**What was done:**
- Phase 0 Orient (full): read SAFEGUARDS, SESSION_NOTES, BACKLOG, ARCHITECTURE_WORKSTREAM; ran dashboard; ghost-session check clean; reported; waited for direction.
- **Evidence-based research** (the greenfield equivalent of the grep-inventory): verified the Quarto CLI surface locally, and ran two parallel research agents against the live `quarto-dev/quarto` repo / Marketplace / official docs.
- **Resolved the load-bearing decision** (TextMate vs LSP) → ship Tier A grammar, build to Tier B in-process providers, defer Tier C out-of-process LSP; with the `vscode`-free-core guardrail making B→C cheap and the core headlessly testable.
- Wrote the plan: `docs/planning/2026-06-27-extension-architecture-plan.md` (447 lines) — 7 phases as vertical slices, each with DONE gate + verification commands + one-session boundary + 🐉 dragon flags; v1 scope + explicit descope; licensing-compliance findings; interface contracts; failure-mode analysis; honest alternatives; §12 ratification list.
- Updated `CONTEXT.md` (decision pointer resolved + 2 new pitfalls) and `CLAUDE.md` (Project-specific Learnings). 
- **Deliverable was OUTPUT, not input** — no plan was provided to me; I produced it.

**Commit:** (see git log — committed at close-out, message `docs: architecture & phased implementation plan (Session 1)`).

**Key files (with line anchors):**
- `docs/planning/2026-06-27-extension-architecture-plan.md` — the deliverable. §3 (lines ~77–137) = the load-bearing decision + the `core/`-vs-adapter guardrail; §6 (~210–337) = the 7 phases; §12 (~411–419) = decisions to ratify; §14 (~437–447) = load-bearing assumptions to verify.
- `CONTEXT.md:40-45` — Architecture Decision Pointer (now resolved → points to the plan).
- `CLAUDE.md` → "Project-specific Learnings" — 4 learnings recorded this session.

**Verified facts (live, this session — trust these):**
- `quarto 1.7.33`; `quarto preview <f>` prints `Browse at http://localhost:<port>/` (the line the preview webview must parse).
- `quarto preview --timeout N` does NOT reliably self-exit (only on no active clients) → the extension must own preview process lifecycle (Phase 4 dragon).
- Code-cell render needs **Jupyter** (`nbformat`) in the active Python env — absent here (degradation case).
- **No `code` CLI on PATH** → manual F5 for runtime checks; `@vscode/test-electron` downloads its own VS Code (verify in Phase 1).

**Gotchas for the next session:**
1. The plan is a **DRAFT** — get operator ratification of §12 before coding (FM #19/#23: a plan in the prompt is not a go-ahead).
2. Implement **Phase 1 ONLY**, then close out (FM #18). The phase numbering is not license to bundle.
3. Quarto cells use brace-wrapped `{python}` identifiers — the stock markdown fenced rule won't match them (Phase 2 dragon, not Phase 1).
4. Licensing is a hard gate: never copy from Posit's AGPL `apps/vscode`/`apps/lsp`. Build on MIT `vscode-markdown-tm-grammar` / `markdown-tm-language` / `vscode-markdown-languageservice`.

**Self-assessment (Session 1): 8.5/10.**
- **+** Resolved the load-bearing decision with two independent evidence passes (both cross-confirmed AGPL + architecture). Did not assume — verified the CLI live and the repo facts via GitHub API. Vertical-slice phasing with per-phase DONE/verification/boundary. Honest descope + alternatives. Flagged dragons and load-bearing assumptions per Learning #3.
- **−** Two typos required in-session correction (stray chars in plan §6; filename in handoff) — caught and fixed, but reflects draft-speed writing. Could not runtime-verify anything (correct for a planning session — no runtime artifact exists; not FM #24). The §12 decisions are proposed, not operator-confirmed, so the plan ships as a draft (by design).

#### Session 0 Handoff Evaluation (by Session 1) — Phase 3A
**Score: 9/10.** Session 0's handoff prepared me well.
- **What helped:** The ACTIVE TASK block was specific and correct — it named the deliverable (plan, not code), the workstream, the load-bearing decision to resolve, the suggested filename/location, and the vertical-slice + FM #18 constraints. The "Useful starting context" (Quarto 1.7.33, Node/npm versions, pointers to CONTEXT/BACKLOG) saved discovery time. The **gotcha was prescient**: "CLAUDE.md is only read at session start, so this setup session never ran Phase 0 — the next session must begin with Phase 0 Orient" — exactly what I did.
- **What was missing:** Nothing material. It could have noted that there is **no git remote** (so `gh issue list` fails and BACKLOG is the source of truth) — minor; I discovered it in one command.
- **What was wrong:** Nothing. Every claim (versions, file layout, adoption mode) checked out.
- **ROI:** Strongly positive — reading it cost ~1 min and saved re-deriving the task framing and constraints.

### Session 0 (Setup / Bootstrap) — 2026-06-27
**Deliverable:** Bootstrap the Iterative Session Methodology (KJ5HST/methodology v3.0) into the project. COMPLETE.
**What was done:**
- `git init` (branch `main`); repo created from an empty directory.
- Ran the methodology's own `bin/sync` (committed mode, local source) — installed `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, `RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md`, `CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`, `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `methodology_dashboard.py`, seeded `SESSION_NOTES.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`/`ROADMAP.md`, and the framework under `docs/methodology/` (+ `workstreams/`).
- Instantiated `CLAUDE.md` (SESSION PROTOCOL + project purpose/stack/build) and `CONTEXT.md` (Quarto domain vocabulary + MIT-license constraint) from the templates.
- Created `BACKLOG.md` (first task = planning session) and `.gitignore` (ignores `dashboard.html`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.vsix`).
- Ran `methodology_dashboard.py` → `dashboard.html` (health 30/100, expected at 0 commits).
**Adoption mode:** Committed (single-project). To update later: clone `KJ5HST/methodology` as a sibling and run `bin/sync`, or tell the agent "Update methodology using https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology".
**Gotcha:** The methodology requires starting a FRESH session before the first real task — `CLAUDE.md` (with the SESSION PROTOCOL) is only read at session start, so this setup session never ran Phase 0 against it. The next session must begin with Phase 0 Orient.
**Self-assessment:** Setup-only session (no predecessor to evaluate — this is Session 0). Bootstrap executed faithfully via the upstream tool rather than hand-copying, so synced files are byte-identical to canonical (no drift; future syncs are clean). No runtime behavior to smoke-test.
**Next:** See ACTIVE TASK above — the planning session.
