# Safeguards

Hard rules for development safety. When this file and other guidance conflict, this file wins.

## The Two-Mode Problem

AI agents operate well in two distinct modes:

1. **Engineer Mode** — Narrow focus. Implement a specific feature, fix a specific bug, write a specific test. Head down, executing against a clear spec.
2. **Architect Mode** — Broad focus. Analyze the codebase, plan a feature, evaluate tradeoffs, design an approach. Head up, surveying the landscape.

**The danger zone is the transition between these modes.** When the agent is mid-implementation and "notices" something that could be improved, refactored, or redesigned — and acts on it without stopping — that's where catastrophic failures originate. The engineer picks up the architect's pen without putting down the wrench.

### The Rule

**Never switch modes without a commit boundary.**

- If you're in Engineer Mode and see something that needs Architect Mode thinking: **commit your current work first**, then switch.
- If you're in Architect Mode and want to start implementing: **get explicit approval first**, then switch.
- If you catch yourself thinking "while I'm at it..." or "I also noticed..." — that's the mode switch happening. **Stop. Commit. Ask.**

## Pre-Flight Checklist (Before Any Multi-File Change)

Run this before touching more than one file:

```
1. git status                    — What's the current state?
2. git diff                      — Any uncommitted changes?
3. Commit everything clean       — No exceptions. Commit BEFORE starting.
4. Verify the build passes       — Don't start from a broken state.
5. State your scope explicitly   — "I am changing X, Y, Z. Nothing else."
```

If there are uncommitted changes from a previous session, **do not touch them**. Report them to the user and ask how to proceed.

## Blast Radius Limits

### Hard Rules (No Exceptions)

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Commit before any multi-file change** | Every disaster becomes a `git checkout` instead of a multi-hour recovery |
| **Never touch more than 5 files without committing first** — the cap is *per-commit*, not per-session | Forces incremental, recoverable progress. A pre-declared vertical slice (`SESSION_RUNNER.md` §Vertical Slice Sessions) may touch more than 5 files across a session, but never more than 5 between checkpoint commits. |
| **Never refactor across module boundaries without plan mode** | Cross-module refactoring is Architect Mode work, period |
| **Never delete a file without verifying it's committed** | `git log --oneline -- <file>` before `rm`. No shortcuts. |
| **Never rename/move files as part of a "quick fix"** | Renames cascade. They are never quick. |
| **"Refactoring" always requires plan mode approval** | Refactoring is not a "just do it" activity. Ever. |

### Scope Creep Red Flags

If any of these phrases appear in the agent's reasoning, it must stop and commit before proceeding:

- "While I'm at it..."
- "I also noticed..."
- "It would be cleaner to..."
- "This is a good opportunity to..."
- "Let me also fix..."
- "This should really be..."

These phrases signal a mode switch is happening. The correct response is: **commit current work, then discuss the new scope with the user.**

## Artifact Integrity

### Read Before Edit

**Re-read any file immediately before modifying it.** Do not edit from memory of a prior read. Memory degrades across long sessions — especially after context compaction. If you haven't read the target section in the last 5 minutes, read it now. This applies to code, documents, configuration files, and any other artifact.

### Preserve User Edits

The user may modify files outside your session — in another editor, between sessions, or through manual intervention. **Never overwrite user-modified content without confirmation.** Check `git blame` or system-reminders to determine if a file has been modified by the user. When in doubt, ask before regenerating.

### Verify the Build Equivalent

Every project has a "build equivalent" — the command that confirms the deliverable is not broken:

| Project Type | Build Equivalent | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Software | `make`, `npm run build`, `cargo build` | Compilation succeeds |
| Documentation (Quarto, LaTeX) | `quarto render`, `pdflatex` | Document renders without errors |
| Data pipeline | Pipeline execution | Output data are produced correctly |
| Configuration | Linting, schema validation | Config passes validation |

**Identify your project's build equivalent during setup and run it after every substantive change.** A deliverable that doesn't pass its build equivalent is broken, regardless of how correct it looks in the source.

For documentation projects, rendering also verifies cross-references, citations, and figure generation — failures in any of these indicate broken content that must be fixed before committing.

### Verify Render-Dependency Completeness

**Build success is not asset-use success.** A render can succeed while silently using different assets than configured: a font family resolves to its Regular face but missing Italic / Bold faces fall back to a default; a CSL file resolves but is the wrong style version; a LaTeX template resolves but a missing class option is silently ignored; a figure-generation script imports a library version different from the one specified. The output looks valid and the build exits cleanly. The defect is invisible unless something checks for it.

If your build produces rendered output that depends on external assets (fonts, citation styles, templates, figure libraries), the build-equivalent check above is necessary but not sufficient. Two additional checks apply:

| When | Check | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Post-render** (every build) | Confirm the rendered output uses the assets it was configured to use (e.g., `pdffonts` shows all expected font faces embedded, not just the family name) | **Hard rule** — part of the build-equivalent step. Failure blocks the commit. | Catches silent fallback that survives correct-looking static config. |
| **Pre-render / setup** (when render-dep config changes) | Confirm each configured asset actually provides the faces / version / features the document uses (e.g., `fc-list "<family>"` returns each expected face; `kpsewhich <Italic-file>` resolves; the CSL version matches the cited style) | **Soft prompt** — surfaces at Phase 0 when render-dep config changes; project decides response based on its toolchain. | Catches mis-configuration without requiring a render. |

A deliverable that compiles, renders, and embeds the right assets is correct. A deliverable that compiles and renders but embeds fallback assets is broken in a way the build will not tell you about — find it before the reader does. See domain workstreams (e.g., `docs/methodology/workstreams/RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md` for research papers) for toolchain-specific verification commands.

## Session Recovery Protocol

**After any session crash, model upgrade, or fresh start, follow this checklist IN ORDER before taking any action:**

### Step 1: Orient (Read Only — Change Nothing)
```
1. Read SESSION_NOTES.md          — What was the last session doing?
2. Check GitHub Issues (`gh issue list`) — What are the current priorities? (Fall back to BACKLOG.md if no repo. BACKLOG.md should contain only open work items — for history see `CHANGELOG.md`, for feature inventory see `ROADMAP.md`.)
3. Read SAFEGUARDS.md             — Refresh the rules (this file)
4. git status                     — What's committed? What's not?
5. git log --oneline -10          — What were the recent commits?
6. git diff --stat                — What's changed but uncommitted?
```

### Step 2: Report (Tell the User What You See)
```
- "Here's the state I found: [summary]"
- "These files are uncommitted: [list]"
- "The last session was working on: [X]"
- "Build status: [passing/failing/unknown]"
```

### Step 3: Get Direction (Ask, Don't Assume)
```
- "Should I commit the uncommitted changes?"
- "Should I continue where the last session left off?"
- "Should I start fresh on something else?"
```

**NEVER resume work from a previous session without completing all three steps.** A new session does not inherit the judgment or context of the previous one. It must verify everything from scratch.

## Commit Discipline

### When to Commit

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Before starting any new task | Commit current state clean |
| After completing any task | Commit immediately |
| Before any refactoring | Commit current state clean |
| Every 15-20 minutes of active work | Checkpoint commit |
| Before switching between modules | Commit current module's changes |
| Before any file deletion or rename | Commit + verify |
| When you feel the urge to "clean up" adjacent code | Commit first, then discuss |

### Commit Message Format
- Feature work: `feat: [description]`
- Bug fixes: `fix: [description]`
- Checkpoint commits: `checkpoint: [what's done so far]`
- WIP commits: `[WIP] [what you're in the middle of]`

**Checkpoint and WIP commits are not optional luxuries. They are safety nets.**

## What the User Should Do

### Honest Feedback for the Operator

**The agent works best when you:**

1. **Give narrow, specific tasks.** "Add a login form to the dashboard" is perfect. "Clean up the frontend" is a disaster waiting to happen.

2. **Demand commits before scope expansion.** When the agent says "I also noticed X needs fixing," your response should be: "Commit what you have first." Every time.

3. **Don't leave the agent unsupervised on broad tasks.** If you're stepping away, give a bounded task with a clear definition of done.

4. **Watch for scope creep language.** "While I'm at it" and "it would be cleaner to" are red flags. Interrupt and redirect.

5. **Use plan mode as a hard gate.** If the agent wants to change the approach or redesign something, make it go through plan mode. Don't let it plan and execute in the same breath.

6. **Set explicit session boundaries.** "This session, only work on X. Nothing else." This gives the agent permission to ignore the things it "notices" and stay focused.

7. **After a session crash or model upgrade, expect the orientation step.** The agent should report what it sees before doing anything. If it jumps straight into action, say "Read SAFEGUARDS.md and orient first."

8. **Trust but verify.** After the agent says it committed, check `git log`. After the agent says tests pass, check the output. Trust is rebuilt through verification, not promises.

### Signs the Agent Is Going Off the Rails

| Warning Sign | What's Happening | Your Response |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| Multiple files changing across modules | Scope creep | "Commit now. What's your scope?" |
| "I noticed we could improve..." | Mode switch mid-task | "Stay on task. Note it for later." |
| Long silence followed by large diffs | Unsupervised refactoring | "Show me git status right now." |
| Recovering from its own errors | Compounding mistakes | "Stop. Show me what happened. Don't fix anything yet." |
| "This is almost done, just need to..." | Sunk cost fallacy | "Commit what works. We'll evaluate." |

## Recovery From Disaster

If the agent has made a mess (failed refactoring, deleted files, broken state):

### Step 1: STOP
Do not let the agent try to fix its own mess. Compounding errors is the #1 cause of data loss.

### Step 2: Assess
```
git status
git log --oneline -20
git stash list
git reflog (for recovering lost commits)
```

### Step 3: Decide Together
- Can we `git checkout` to a known good state?
- Do we need to cherry-pick specific commits?
- Is there uncommitted work worth saving?

### Step 4: Never Let It Happen Again
- What safeguard was skipped?
- Add it to this document if it's not already here.
